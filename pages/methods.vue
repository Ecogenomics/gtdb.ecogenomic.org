      <template #multiple-sequence-alignment>
        Bacterial and archaeal multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are formed from the concatenation of 120 (bac120)
        or 53 (arc53) phylogenetically informative markers, respectively. These markers are comprised of
        proteins or protein domains specified in the Pfam v33.1 or TIGRFAMs v15.0 databases. Details on
        these markers are available for download (<a href="https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/latest/" target="_blank">here</a>). Gene calling is performed with Prodigal v2.6.3,
        and markers identified and aligned using HMMER v3.1b1. Columns in the MSA with >50% gaps or with a
        single amino acid spanning <25% or >95% of taxa are removed. In order to reduce computational
        requirements of the bacterial reference tree, 42 amino acids per marker were randomly selected
        from the remaining columns to produce a MSA of ~5,000 columns. The final masks applied to the
        concatenated MSAs are available for download (<a href="https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/latest/" target="_blank">here</a>)
        and the identical filtering approach is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ecogenomics/gtdbtk" target="_blank">GTDB-Tk</a>.

        <ol type="i">
          <li>CheckM completeness estimate >50%</li>
          <li>CheckM contamination estimate <10%</li>

        </ol>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Filtered genomes are manually inspected and exceptions are made for genomes of high
          nomenclatural or taxonomic significance, e.g. the isolate genome

          i and iv to vii are also retained if >80% of all duplicate marker genes are 100% identical

      <template #updating-gtdb-species-representatives>
        <p>
          Each GTDB species is defined by a single representative genome and species assignments
          established by considering the ANI and AF to these representative genomes (Parks et al.,
          Nature Biotechnology, 2019). Species representatives are re-evaluated each GTDB release
          with an emphasis placed on retaining representatives so they can serve as effective
          nomenclatural type material. However, the goal of stable representatives must be balanced
          with the desire to use high-quality genomes as representatives, the incorporation of
          changing taxonomic opinion, and identified errors in genome classification or assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
          GTDB representatives are updated according to two primary principles: i) representatives
          should be assembled from the type strain of a species whenever possible, and ii) representatives
          should only be replaced by assembles of suitably higher overall quality. These two principles
          are quantitatively defined by the balanced ANI score (BAS) given by:
          <code>0.5 * (ANI score) + 0.5 * (quality score)</code>
          where the ANI score is 100 â€“ 20*(100 - ANI to current representative) and the quality
          score is defined by the criteria given in Table 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          An existing representative is only
          replaced by a new representative if it has a BAS >= 10 above the BAS of the current
          representative. Intuitively, the BAS achieves the goal of stable representatives by
          requiring a new representative to be of increasingly higher quality (as defined by the
          quality score) the more dissimilar it is from the current representative (as defined by
          the ANI score).
        </p>
        <p>
          Representatives are also updated to account for genome assemblies being removed from
          NCBI and representatives are updated whenever the underlying assembly is updated at NCBI.

      <template #updating-name-of-gtdb-species-clusters>
        <p>
          The names assigned to GTDB species clusters are re-evaluated each GTDB release with an
          emphasize placed on nomenclature stability. However, names are changed in some cases to
          reflect changes in taxonomic opinions and/or to correct identified errors in GTDB or NCBI
          assignments. Species clusters containing one or more genomes assembled from the type strain
          of a species are named after the species with nomenclatural priority
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/ijsem.0.000778" target="_blank">(Parker et al., 2019)</a>,
          with the generic and specific names changed as necessary to reflect any genus level
          reclassifications in the GTDB. Species names identified as synonyms are provided as separated
          file in the GTDB repository and updated each release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Species clusters without a type strain genome are assigned via a majority voting approach
          based on NCBI species assignments regarded as correct under the GTDB framework. A genome is
          considered to have an erroneous NCBI species assignment if a genome assembled from the type
          strain of this species exists and resides in a different GTDB species cluster. A cluster is
          assigned a name by majority voting if >50% of genomes in the cluster with a GTDB-validated NCBI
          name are from a single species and >50% of all genomes with this species classification are in
          the cluster. Otherwise, the species cluster is assigned an alphanumeric or Latin suffixed
          placeholder name. In order to maximize the stability of GTDB names, placeholder names are not
          updated to new placeholder names (e.g., Bacillus sp002153395 to B. subtilis_A or vice versa) even
          if an updated placeholder name might better reflect the current classification of genomes within
          a cluster.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Species clusters containing an assembly from the type strain of a subspecies or a subspecies
          satisfying the majority voting criteria will have the subspecies name promoted to the specific
          name of the cluster in cases where a placeholder name would otherwise be required.
